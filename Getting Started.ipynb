    "Virtual enviroments are really important for any python programmer to know. THey allow you to have multiple versions of python installed on your computer and switch between them. This is really important for this project because we need to install a specific version of pytorch and torchvision. If you don't use a virtual enviroment you will have to uninstall your current version of pytorch and torchvision and install the specific version we need. This is a pain and can cause a lot of problems."
